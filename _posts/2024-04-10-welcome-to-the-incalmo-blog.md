We are building Incalmo to deliver autonomous cybersecurity that keeps pace with modern attackers. This blog will be the place where we share what we are learning as we build, ship, and secure AI-driven systems.<!--more-->

Expect a mix of engineering deep dives, product updates, and candid write-ups of what works (and what does not). We believe transparency creates better security outcomes for everyone, and we hope these notes help the broader community.

If there is something specific you would like us to explore, reach out to the team and let us know. We are just getting started.
