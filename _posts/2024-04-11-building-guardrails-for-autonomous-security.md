title: "Building Guardrails for Autonomous Security"
description: "How we think about balancing autonomy and control in security operations."

Great security tooling should take action without creating new risks. That is the bar we hold Incalmo to every day.<!--more-->

In practice, that means every autonomous workflow ships with layered guardrails:

- Continuous policy evaluation to ensure an action aligns with an organization's intent
- Context-aware simulations that validate outcomes before they reach production systems
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints when high-impact decisions need an expert's eyes

Getting those building blocks right requires a blend of SOC expertise, reliable infrastructure, and a deep respect for the operators who keep businesses safe. Over the next few weeks we will share more about how we are implementing each layer and the lessons we pick up along the way.
